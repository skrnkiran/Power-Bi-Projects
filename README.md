# Power-Bi-Projects

This repository contains two Power BI projects focused on analysing and visualising real-world datasets. The first project explores sales data for a finance company, providing insights into sales performance, profit trends, product performance, and regional distribution through interactive dashboards.

The second project analyses global COVID-19 data, visualising total cases, deaths, recoveries, testing rates, and continent-level trends. The dashboards are designed to present complex data clearly, enabling users to explore patterns and comparisons across time and geography.

These projects demonstrate skills in data modelling, DAX measures, interactive visualisation, and translating raw data into meaningful insights using Power BI.
